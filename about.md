I am Ryan Scott, a computer science Ph.D student at [Indiana University](https://www.indiana.edu/) (IU), working under the supervision of [Dr. Ryan Newton](http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~rrnewton/homepage.html).

I work primarily with [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), a purely functional programming language. I also occasionally contribute to [GHC](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/), the Glasgow Haskell Compiler. You can see what I'm working on at [GitHub](https://github.com/RyanGlScott).

### Contact me

Send e-mails to ryan.gl.scott@{gmail.com,indiana.edu}, or find me on IRC as @RyanGlScott.
