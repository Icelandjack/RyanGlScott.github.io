I am Ryan Scott, a computer science student at the [University of Kansas](http://www.ku.edu/) (KU), currently pursuing a bachelor's degree.

I currently work for the [Functional Programming Group](http://www.ittc.ku.edu/csdl/fpg/index.html) (FPG) at KU, under the supervision of [Dr. Andy Gill](http://www.ittc.ku.edu/csdl/fpg/users/andygill.html). In the FPG, I am involved with the [HERMIT](http://www.ittc.ku.edu/csdl/fpg/software/hermit.html) project, and I am doing some work with Android and Bluetooth on the side.
