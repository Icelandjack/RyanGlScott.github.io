### Education
* [**University of Kansas (KU)**](http://ku.edu/), Lawrence, KS — August 2011–May 2015 (expected)
  
  Pursuing B.S. in Computer Science with Mathematics minor  

### Experience
* **Student Research Assistant**, [Information and Telecommunication Technology Center (ITTC)](http://www.ittc.ku.edu/), Lawrence, KS — Summer 2012–present

  Applied functional programming techniques (using Haskell and Scala) to software domains such as networking, mobile devices, and animation  
  
  Designed large Android apps that interface with web and Bluetooth servers  


### ITTC Software Projects
* **[`bluetooth`](https://github.com/RyanGlScott/bluetooth)** (developer and maintainer). Haskell bindings to low-level Bluetooth APIs written in C. Simplifies the process of making Bluetooth code that works with different OSes.
* **[`Win32-unicode-io`](https://github.com/RyanGlScott/Win32-unicode-io)** (developer and maintainer). An alternative Haskell prelude that uses native Windows console API functions to correctly output Unicode characters.
* **[HERMIT](https://github.com/ku-fpg/hermit/)** (contributor and tester). An interactive Haskell compiler plugin that allows a user to apply code rewrites to make the process of high-assurance software development easier. HERMIT applies several semi-formal modeling techniques such as the worker/wrapper transformation.
* **[Armatus](https://github.com/ku-fpg/armatus)** (co-developer). An Android app that interfaces with a HERMIT session via a RESTful web server. armatus assists in the process of code rewriting through graphical shortcuts and mobile-specific gestures not possible in a command-line setting.
* **ExhibitPlus** (co-developer). An Android app that augments a museum by allowing users to learn more information about exhibits by scanning specialized QR codes.

* Won CCSC: Central Plains programming contest as part of a Competitive Programming team (2013)
* Volunteered as a member of [KU Alternative Spring Breaks](http://kualternativebreaks.com/):
 * Repaired park equipment and taught science classes to youth groups at the [Urban Ecology Center](http://urbanecologycenter.org/) (2013)
 * Removed invasive plant species and distributed produce to community centers at [Johnson's Backyard Garden](https://www.jbgorganic.com/) in Austin, TX (2012)
